# Clustering-Analysis-Adult-Dataset
This repository contains the code and analysis for a clustering project performed on the Adult Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

The project explores various clustering techniques, including K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), DBSCAN, and Spectral Clustering. The goal is to identify meaningful clusters within the dataset, which includes demographic and financial attributes such as age, education, occupation, and income.

Key steps in the project include:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, one-hot encoding categorical variables, and standardizing numerical features.

Feature Selection: Using correlation analysis and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify relevant features for clustering.

Cluster Estimation: Employing methods like the Elbow Method, Silhouette Score, and Davies-Bouldin Index to determine the optimal number of clusters.

Clustering Techniques: Implementing and comparing multiple clustering algorithms to evaluate their performance.

Visualization: Generating heatmaps, dendrograms, and cluster plots to interpret and visualize the results.

The repository includes R scripts for data processing, clustering, and visualization, along with a detailed report summarizing the findings and comparisons of different clustering methods. This project is ideal for those interested in data clustering, unsupervised learning, and exploratory data analysis.
